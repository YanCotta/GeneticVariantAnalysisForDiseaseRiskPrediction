# Genetic Variant Analysis Pipeline for Disease Risk Prediction

A production-grade bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing genetic variants and predicting disease risks, incorporating advanced statistical genetics and machine learning approaches.

## Scientific Background

This pipeline implements state-of-the-art methods for:
- Population stratification correction using principal component analysis
- Linkage disequilibrium pruning for variant independence
- Polygenic risk score calculation with validated weights
- Cross-population validation to ensure robust predictions

## Key Features

### Data Processing
- Automated QC with configurable thresholds
- Multi-format support (VCF, PLINK, CSV)
- Population stratification handling
- Batch effect correction

### Analysis Pipeline
- GPU-accelerated computations
- Multiple ML models (Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Advanced feature selection with biological context
- Cross-validation with population stratification

### Reporting
- Publication-quality visualizations
- Clinical interpretation guidelines
- Population-specific risk assessments
- Confidence intervals for predictions

## Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install with GPU support
pip install -e ".[gpu]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
from genetic_variant_analysis.core import VariantAnalysisPipeline

pipeline = VariantAnalysisPipeline()
results = pipeline.run("variants.vcf")
```
